The reason there are a ton of files is that I took screenshots of some examples to show that each analyzer actually works and operates as designed.

The file titled, "Lexical.py" is the lexical analyzer, "Syntax.py" is the syntax analyzer. The file "Semantic.py" is the semantic analyzer. 

As stated I have also included numerous screenshots showing that the code works and analyzes as programmed. Also "test.txt" is a file you can edit and use to test the program for yourself.
